# ResNet9_Plant_Disease
This project implements a deep learning model from scratch to identify plant diseases from leaf images with high accuracy. No pretrained models were used; the network was built and trained entirely from scratch.
Custom ResNet9 architecture designed for efficient image classification.

Achieved 99.14% validation accuracy on the New Plant Diseases Dataset (Augmented).

Training techniques implemented:

  1 - One Cycle Learning Rate Policy for efficient training.
  
  2 - Weight decay for regularization.

  3 - Gradient clipping to stabilize training.

Visualizations included:

1 - Training and validation loss curves.

2 - Validation accuracy curve.

3 - Sample predictions on test images.
